# Thinkful Qualified Challenges

This repo is a collection of challenges that I have completed throughout my coursework at Thinkful. With few exceptions, each assessment is accompanied by a test suite, all tests of which needed to be passing prior to submission. 

## Note:
* As of October 2021, I am still enrolled full-time in this immersive program. Therefore, this repo will updated with future assessments daily.
* The organization of this repo represents the order in which the Thinkful Immersion Curriculum has played out with nearly precise accuracy.

## Future Plans:
I have ongoing plans for architecting this repo in a user-friendly layout. As the program is currently ongoing, many old assessments have yet to be added, and several current assessments have yet to be sorted.
